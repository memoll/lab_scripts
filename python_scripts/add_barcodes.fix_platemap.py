####a script to create an analysis-ready mapping file and platemap with descriptive names from 96 well plate metadata files (metadata file, plate map, barcode plate spreadsheet -> mapping file w metadata & barcodes, plate map with descriptive names)####
##IMPORTANT: all inputs should be tab separated text files
##inputs:
###1. visual layout of 96 well plate (grid format). user must make this file. (plate map, has swab IDs in place of sample names)
###2. spreadsheet with barcodes in each primer plate. each plate has a unique barcode sequence
###3. metadata file that links swab IDs to sample names, plus other metadata.
